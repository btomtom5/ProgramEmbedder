import tensorflow as tf

# create an RNN(LSTM)that takes in a tokenized Abstract Syntax Tree
# will output the weights for a neural network that is fully connected

# Use the neural network to predict the output for multiple input/output pairs

# Use the loss on the neural network in order to train the LSTM RNN


# import the train, test, eval datasets
# I need tensorflow records that contain the asts(as sequences) as well as the post conditions and pre-conditions
# This is the same inputs that are used in matrix learner




# define the neural network pipeline






# start session that runs the data through the pipeline:
